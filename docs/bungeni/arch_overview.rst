Software Architecture Overview
==============================


Scope
:::::

The scope of this section is to help a developer to understand the deployment configuration and to provide
an understanding of how to modify the existing features and to create new ones. The system is composed of
many different modules and each requires knowledge of the used technology, this section provides a global vision
and does not attempt to try to explain everything.

Description
:::::::::::

To describe the architecture of Bungeni, UML will be used. Some snippets of code will be provided where necessary to
describe bash file configurations, python code, paster and deliverance configuration files.

Logical Views

Logical Elements
----------------

The main logical elements are described below:

    * Theming component: this provides a coherent look and feel to the BungeniPortal and BungeniCMS.
    * Dispatcher redirects the incoming requests to the correct URL inside the main applications.
    * BugneniPortal provides the parliament functionalities.
    * BugeniDB is a relational DB, it stores the data of BungeniPortal
    * BungeniCMS contains the general materials, it manages the content that is stored in the system. BungeniCMS uses an integrated object DB (not shown in the diagram)
    * Static resources are the images and CSS files which are served straight from the server's file system.
